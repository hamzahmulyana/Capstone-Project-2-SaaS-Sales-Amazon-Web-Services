## About

Amazon Web Services (AWS) SaaS Solutions is a company that provides cloud-based software solutions for business management. Over the past year, the company has faced significant challenges in improving the profitability of their SaaS products. Sales data reveals variations in discounts offered, sales performance by region, and product profit margins. With this information, the company aims to analyze and understand the factors influencing profitability, as well as identify and implement strategies to enhance profit margins and sales efficiency.

The analysis process is as follows:

1. **Objective**, Despite being a leader in Cloud Computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has experienced a decline in profitability due to substantial discounts on products, variations in sales performance across regions, and suboptimal pricing strategies. To address these issues, AWS aims to implement a dynamic pricing strategy that aligns with market demand and competition to enhance profitability without significantly reducing sales volume.
2. **Data Transformation**, Evaluating the condition of the data. Checking for outliers, anomalies and null values. Also, we added a number of new columns to give a broader picture on the scope of Transjakarta
3. **Data Analysis**, Analyzing data.
4. **Conclusion and Recommendation**, Providing conclusions based on analysis, giving action recommendation, and a follow-up plan.
